<h2 class="wlsn-news-list-item__title">Where Traditional Succession Planning Falls Short</h2>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">When a key leader suddenly departs, many firms scramble&mdash;despite having a succession plan. In this article, the authors argue that typical planning is reactive, opaque, and outdated. They call for pivots: from replacement charts to leadership development, scenario‑based readiness, execution over exercise, and building future‑ready leaders.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Western managers often struggle leading global teams due to culturally rooted leadership styles emphasising autonomy and authenticity.
