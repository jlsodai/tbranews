In this multi-stakeholder role, the Chair will guide the board in providing robust oversight, foster an effective partnership with the CEO, and <b>leverage their influence and networks to open doors, cultivate strategic relationships, and enhance the organisation's profile</b>.</p>
  
  <p>The ideal candidate will bring senior leadership experience and a proven track record in board leadership, alongside a <b>strong understanding of Kenya's youth employment, education, and or labour market landscape</b>. Experience in the nonprofit or social impact sector and the ability to engage credibly across diverse stakeholders will be highly regarded.</p>
