        <p>A powerful conversation is coming soon and you won’t want to miss it. Our colleague Zahirah Marty sits down with Ramazani Uwezo from the Refugee-Led Research Hub, the lead research institution behind the Pathways to Employment series commissioned by Amahoro Coalition. Together, they unpack emerging patterns shaping refugee employment across Africa, with reflections drawn from 15 countries and produced in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation. From legal frameworks and administrative systems to employer perspectives, cross-sector collaboration, youth dynamics and the role of women, this discussion sheds light on how smarter policies and stronger private-sector engagement can unlock talent and expand access to dignified work across the continent. Stay tuned: the full conversation will be released soon.</p>

        <p>We visited the African Leadership University and Kepler College in Kigali, Rwanda to introduce our new Skills Hub which is Amahoro Coalition’s digital platform designed to connect forcibly displaced persons to meaningful economic opportunities across Africa. The Hub features job and internship opportunities from across the continent with a focus on refugees and displaced talent, enables partners to create accounts and upload their talent pools, generates analytics to measure impact, allows direct referrals to employers, and helps identify companies and sectors ready to absorb skilled candidates. Students from Rwanda and across Africa explored how the platform links young people to practical training, mentorship, and employment opportunities aligned with their ambitions. The conversations also highlighted entrepreneurship as a route to self-reliance and offered guidance on crafting a strong, well-rounded CV, followed by an engaging Q&A.</p>

        <p>Our media partner African Business has published a feature titled <b>"How a shift of viewpoint can see refugees as assets and innovators,"</b> reflecting on our side event held during UNGA 80. The article highlights a core message from the discussion: while Africa hosts 50 million displaced people, often confined to overcrowded camps with limited prospects, a change in perspective reveals refugee communities as economic contributors and hubs of innovation. With conflicts and climate pressures driving further displacement, the piece underscores the need for solutions that move beyond food and shelter toward models that unlock talent, enterprise, and resilience. Rather than being seen as burdens, refugees can become active participants in shaping economies, and settlements can serve as environments where ideas and innovation benefit society at large.</p>

        <p>Our colleagues Gerald Kilimo, Saniya Syeda and Kris Senani reflect on how to unlock the potential of refugee markets in Africa, drawing parallels with Kenya’s financial sector transformation. They recall how banks once dismissed small farmers and informal traders as "unproductive," until Equity Bank removed barriers, redesigned products and proved that inclusion could be both profitable and transformative. They also argue that refugee economies sit at a similar turning point, too often framed as charity despite evidence of strong, responsive markets, and poses a compelling challenge: if Kenya’s informal economy was once misunderstood and then unlocked through design, trust, and scale, what are we still getting wrong about refugee markets today?</p>

        <p>Next month in Geneva, the second <b>Global Refugee Forum Progress Review</b> will convene to accelerate the matching of pledges with resources and partners, while mobilizing renewed support for policies that advance protection, inclusion, and durable solutions. As a stakeholder to the Global Refugee Compact, Amahoro Coalition will take part in the Review, reflecting on the commitments we made at the 2019 and 2023 Forums to mobilize the private sector in creating market-based opportunities for refugees. Our pledges include securing 50,000 jobs for forcibly displaced individuals, catalyzing over USD 30 million in private-sector investment benefiting displaced communities and hosting markets, and supporting 120 displaced youth leaders across Africa through training, mentorship, private-sector connections, and market access via our Fellowship program. We will also disburse more than USD 5 million to help these young leaders grow and scale their organizations.</p>

        <h3>Reflections from the Field: Understanding Nigeria’s Displacement Landscape</h3>

        <p>Our colleague Julius Muriuki has been working with internally displaced people across Nigeria. In this piece he shares some of his reflections on what makes Nigeria’s displacement context unique compared to East Africa, where refugees are often concentrated in camps. He highlights the scale, dispersion, and complexity of Nigeria’s situation, where more than 3 million people are displaced across vast distances, while also pointing to promising opportunities in job readiness training, digital skills, and agriculture that can restore dignity and create livelihoods for displaced communities.</p>
        <p>Drawing from his experience, Julius reflects on the logistical and financial challenges of reaching displaced populations spread across multiple states, but also on the resilience and creativity of these communities. He underscores how partnerships with organizations like Jobberman and initiatives such as the Amahoro Skills Hub are paving new pathways to employment. Most importantly, he reminds us that with the right investment and coordination, Nigeria’s displaced populations can become active contributors to food systems, local economies, and national stability.</p>

        <p>Our Pathways to Employment Report reveals that refugees in Nigeria, despite their skills and resilience. face major barriers to work.</p>
        <p>Policy ambiguity, restrictive requirements like the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, and limited private sector engagement have left many refugees excluded from formal employment. Most rely on informal work, small unregistered businesses, or incentive-based volunteering, while opportunities in digital livelihoods remain underdeveloped.</p>
        <p>At Amahoro Coalition, we believe this must change. Refugees are not a burden but a resource for Nigeria’s economy. We are calling for clear employment guidelines, targeted exemptions, stronger entrepreneurship support, and deeper private sector partnerships to unlock this potential.</p>

        <p>They called him “Mai boola“, the trash carrier. It was a condescending nickname, a dismissal of a man who had left a respectable teaching job to wade into the messy, informal world of waste collection. To his family, it didn’t make sense that a university graduate with a degree in pure and applied chemistry would choose a path that looked, to them, like a step backward.</p>
        <p>But for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/agwukaluibe/">Agwu Kalu Ibe</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/levelup-recyclers-limited/">LevelUp Recyclers Limited</a>, this path was a direct line to solving some of Nigeria’s most deeply entrenched problems. His company, launched in December 2020, isn’t just about waste management. It’s a social enterprise built on a simple but powerful idea: turning waste into wealth, not for one person, but for the most vulnerable people in the value chain.</p>
        <p>Based in Abuja, Level Up Recyclers specifically partners with people living in the city’s 16 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, creating predictable income for communities shattered by conflict.</p>

        <p>Amahoro Coalition brought together private sector leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and refugees in New York this week, on the sidelines of the UN’s 80th General Assembly, to explore how migration and forced displacement will shape the markets of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>At a time when migrants are too often excluded or seen as a burden, our dialogue highlighted a different truth: displaced people are contributors, bringing economic, social and cultural value to their host communities.</p>
        <p>Key insights stood out: displaced populations are untapped markets of talent and innovation; the private sector must lead in turning potential into opportunity; and Africa’s demographic dividend cannot be unlocked if millions of marginalized people are left behind.</p>
        <p>Migration is one of the defining challenges of our time and one where cooperation, investment, and fresh thinking can turn vulnerability into shared prosperity.</p>

        <p>Our colleagues Isaac Kwaku Fokuo, Curator and Founder, and Tito Mbathi, Senior Strategy Innovator at Amahoro Coalition, contributed an opinion piece to the New African special #UNGA80 edition, shedding light on how Africa’s displaced people are far more than a humanitarian challenge, they are a powerful economic force.</p>
        <p>Opening with the story of Fatima, a livestock trader in Mogadishu who runs an export network to the Gulf entirely from her phone, the article argues that Africa’s more than 50 million displaced persons represent one of the world’s most overlooked markets: innovative, resilient, and generating billions in annual economic activity. At a time when traditional aid is shrinking, this moment presents a unique opportunity for market-based solutions that combine development impact with sustainable returns.</p>
