	<p>Dear [[FIRSTNAME]],</p>
	<p>The African Collaborative tackles systemic funding disparities that limit access to resources for African-led social impact organisations. Although global philanthropic funding is substantial, these organisations still receive only a small share. Through multi-year unrestricted grants and tailored portfolio support, the initiative ensures African leaders gain the tools and visibility needed to drive lasting systems change. With a core focus on proximity, equity, and sustainability, it bridges funding gaps and shifts power toward locally-driven solutions.</p>
	<p>To help advance this mission, the African Collaborative is seeking a passionate, committed individual to join its Board of Directorsâ€”someone with expertise in financial management, fundraising, or strong ties to the African philanthropy ecosystem.</p>
