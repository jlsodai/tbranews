Acceptance Criteria
Given that a candidate profile is open, when a recruiter adds a comment, then the comment is saved and visible to all authorized team members.
Given that a team member is mentioned in a comment, when the comment is submitted, then the mentioned user receives a notification.
Given that a recruiter views a candidate profile, when comments exist, then they are displayed in a chronological thread with timestamps and user identifiers.
Given that permissions are correctly configured, when a non-authorized user views the profile, then the comments section is hidden or inaccessible.
Given that collaboration is ongoing, when a team member refreshes the page or logs back in, then all previous comments persist and remain linked to the profile.



Now that we are done with the search creation process, clients can now start the recruitment process.
