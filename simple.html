	<p>Dear [[FIRSTNAME]],</p>

	
	<p>​​Discover a new way to connect with fellow TBrA members by sharing your upcoming trips! Our Member's Forum offers two features for seamless connections: 'Check-In' and 'Trip'.</p>
<p>With 'Check-In', you can instantly update others about your location. By typing the &lsquo;@&rsquo; symbol, you can tag users and include a text update for your live feed posting. To add your location, just type it in the 'Check-in location' box to see a preview on the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to notify specific people? Choose "Notify People" to select members or locations. Choose people to notify either by using the search box or by selecting profiles under the Users List. You can filter members further by specifying the location and organisation fields. Once you've completed the form, hit 'Publish', and your post will appear on the Live Feed.</p>
<p>For future travels, use the 'Trip' feature to let fellow members know about your upcoming plans and destinations. Connecting has never been easier!</p>
<p>Here's a simple guide to sharing your upcoming trips with fellow members:</p>
