	<p>Dear [[FIRSTNAME]],</p>
	<p>We hope this email finds you well.</p>
	<p>We wanted to take a moment to once again express our sincere gratitude for being part of the EMERGE mentorship programme. We understand that mentoring requires a significant time commitment to guide and support our mentees in their growth and development - so thank you!..</p>
	<p>We trust that your first session with your mentee has either already taken place or will be happening soon. May this journey be filled with enriching experiences and meaningful connections that empower both you and your mentee.</p>
	<p>As we navigate through this mentorship programme together, please remember that we are here to support you in any way we can if you encounter any challenges. Additionally, if your mentee is late or does not show up for a scheduled session, please inform us so that we can address the situation promptly and effectively.</p>
	<p>Thank you once again for your unwavering support and commitment. Your guidance is shaping the future of our mentees in remarkable ways.</p>
	<p>Warm regards,</p>
	<p>Brenda</p>
