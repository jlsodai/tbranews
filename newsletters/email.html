<h2 class="wlsn-news-list-item__title">Overcoming Competitive Pressures: &ldquo;Making&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Milking&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Business strategy is fundamentally about allocating scarce resources to create the greatest impact on organisational performance. In the domain of innovation strategy, there is a tendency for strategists to focus almost exclusively on value creation. Such a narrow focus may be detrimental to firm returns, as it may lock rival firms into a needless lose-lose race for value creation.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Most change management has shifted from a simplistic, top-down, &ldquo;create a vision, change the structure, roll out the new program, and get buy-in&rdquo; approach to more emergent, empowered, and purpose-led approaches.

The force that has the greatest impact on change outcomes is humans&rsquo; primary need to belong.

One way to learn to do this better is to think about leadership as a series of small actions that are practiced, then carefully sequenced and interwoven during interactions.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Employees need their managers to show compassion. At the same time, executives expect their managers and their teams to deliver results. Middle managers are often the ones feeling that tension most acutely. How can they cope with these competing pressures?&nbsp;First, work to increase the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;compassion capacity&rdquo; &mdash; that is, help equip both senior executives and employees to shoulder more of the burden in delivering compassion so that it doesn&rsquo;t fall entirely on you.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Companies will need to adopt a more personalized approach to employee well-being. Workers are concerned about increased automation, job insecurity, the need to upskill, and the possibility of being redeployed to new roles. To truly support wellness as a meaningful and sustainable benefit, companies should view well-being as more than something that provides momentary relief. Instead, well-being should be something that sustains people over the long term.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Simply put, corporate culture consists of the prevailing beliefs and behaviors that guide workplace interactions. &ldquo;About 30% of executives taking new jobs fail to figure out the company&rsquo;s culture correctly and end up leaving relatively soon,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Peter Crist, chairman of executive-recruitment firm Crist/Kolder Associates.

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Throughout the pandemic, there has been a lot of discussion about the qualities that matter most in employees. We hear about the importance of being an agile learner or embracing ambiguity, for example. Those are important attributes, of course, but we can&rsquo;t lose sight of a foundational quality that sets the best team players apart: reliability. Reliability is a theme that has come up often in my many interviews with CEOs over the years, but Brett Wilson, who shared with me the memorable concept of the do-to-say ratio.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">To become more diverse, equitable, and inclusive, many companies have turned to unconscious bias (UB) training. By raising awareness of the mental shortcuts that lead to snap judgments&mdash;often based on race and gender&mdash;about people&rsquo;s talents or character, it strives to make hiring and promotion fairer and improve interactions with customers and among colleagues. But most UB training is ineffective, research shows.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">In my last few posts, I have argued that leaders need to set the tone in the first five minutes of their meetings and then actively design the middle to keep people energized and productive. These steps are critical, but they are not the whole story. Leaders also need to be thoughtful and deliberate about how they end meetings to ensure the team walks away with clear decisions and shared commitment to implementing the next steps.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">In the world of business, leaders aren&rsquo;t only giving advice&mdash;they&rsquo;re getting it too. eaders are often surrounded by others with well-intentioned advice on how they should run their businesses or how they can succeed in top leadership positions. However, not all of it should be followed.

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Honest conversations are a crucial tool in helping leaders and their organizations successfully act on their ethical ambitions. If you aspire to lead ethically and with high purpose, first turn inwards. Take the time to have an honest conversation with yourself to help figure out what matters to you, and where your ethics lie. Next, align your senior team. Third, be prepared to be derailed. Unfortunately, at some point, pressure to meet shareholder expectations will derail your aspiration to lead with a higher purpose and values.</p>

These moves help address five questions that participants and facilitators in all collaborations&mdash;regardless of the particulars of the situation&mdash;need to work through.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">Equity analysts and business reporters who cover corporate earnings calls are all too familiar with executives&rsquo; indirect answers to direct questions. Execs may go off-topic or divulge too much information. Some lie to evade uncomfortable topics. And then there&rsquo;s the non-answer answer such as &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t disclose those numbers&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">In the corporate setting, we understand intuitively that creativity fuels strategy, innovation, and growth. In a world where machines are taking over predictable, tedious tasks, it&rsquo;s no surprise that there&rsquo;s a mounting premium on the kinds of skills, such as creativity, that machines cannot (yet) replicate.But there&rsquo;s a less appreciated benefit of creativity that is just as powerful. Creative employees are more likely to take the kind of &ldquo;good&rdquo; risks that lead to innovation.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">When leaders dedicate resources and capability to winning the fight on the ground but make little investment in understanding the complexity of what happens next, it is difficult to maintain peace.

But they don&rsquo;t plan for the long-term sustainability of that change. Transformations are notoriously challenging, and most companies fail. Even those that initially succeed often don&rsquo;t maintain changes made.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">The &ldquo;Big Quit,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Great Resignation&rdquo; is a post-widespread-vaccination phenomenon heavily affecting the workplace. A record 4 million people resigned&nbsp;in April. The same thing is starting to happen in higher paid jobs. Polls show that nearly 40% of white-collar employees would rather quit&nbsp;than give up remote work, and even&nbsp;companies like Apple are scrambling to avoid mass resignations from return-to-office policies.</p>

The sad reality is that too many either don&#39;t have the skills or the confidence in their skills, and they double down on trying to have control. This is where we see the emergence of micro-managers. They want to know everything about every aspect. It&#39;s their way of trying to keep control and shape the outcome.</p>

They drone on in numerous meetings, which usually doesn&#39;t work. What usually happens in such situations is that employees begin to express themselves the same way as the leader -- ineffectively. Leadership-by-PowerPoint lacks the impact of a leader leading from the front, by example.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">A year ago, COVID-19 forced many companies to send employees home&mdash;often with a laptop and a prayer. With COVID cases subsiding and vaccinations rising, the prospect of returning to old office routines appears more possible. But will employees want to flock back to buildings even when it&rsquo;s safe again? Should companies do away with Zoom and return the workplace to its pre-COVID ways? The answer, in a word: No.&rdquo;&nbsp;So how can business leaders create a new work world that will keep employees both happy and productive post-COVID?</p>

Socrates, whom one priestess pegged as the wisest man in the ancient world, discussed the maxim with his pupils Xenophon and Plato, creating the foundation for its modern meaning as an exhortation to be self-aware (versus an admonition to subordinate ourselves to the gods).&nbsp;And today, self-awareness &mdash; or metacognition, as psychologists and neuroscientists call it &mdash; is just as relevant, especially for leaders</p>

The author offers four research-based practices for leaders to master to earn and keep the trust of others. First, make your values clear, then make sure you&rsquo;re living up to them. Second, treat others and their work with dignity. Third, determine when to be vulnerable and open and when to protect confidences.

Two teams were marooned on a desert island to compete for a cash prize. Participants were ordinary folk who struggled in the harsh terrain. Thus, it was all the more surprising when both teams quickly voted out their only member with the survival skills needed. At the core lay allegations of bossiness and control-freakery when most wanted to work together as a team. This example shows that you can have the exact experience your organisation needs, know what needs doing, and be in the right place at the right time to make it happen.</p>

While the medium of meetings has shifted for many, the need to come together in groups to collaborate, discuss project progress, and tackle work challenges is ever present. In fact, the number of meetings per day has actually increased since many workplaces went completely remote in 2020. A report by Upwork predicts that by 2025, 36.2 million Americans will be working remotely &mdash; almost a 90% increase from pre-pandemic levels. In short, virtual meetings aren&rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

How sure you are about what&rsquo;s true? If you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 99% positive he&rsquo;s lying&rdquo; or &ldquo;I guarantee this will work,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re displaying epistemic confidence. Then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;social confidence,&rdquo; or self-assuredness. When you&rsquo;re in a group setting, do you act like you deserve to be there, like you&rsquo;re secure in yourself and in your role? If you speak as if you&rsquo;re worth listening to, you&rsquo;re displaying social confidence.</p>

While some businesses have boomed amid demand for video conferencing and collaborative technology, the CEOs of other firms will likely face difficult decisions, if they haven&rsquo;t already.

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">People with disabilities are critical for businesses and the economy, both as workers to ease the talent shortage and as consumers controlling more than $13 trillion in annual disposable income. In addition, the insights and designs of people with disabilities have shaped technological advancements for decades. From the first typewriter invented to help a blind woman write, to the precursor of e-mail for a deaf couple to communicate, to audio books initially created for the blind, to the remote control for people with limited mobility, people with disabilities have fueled innovation through principles of universal design.</p>

<p class="wlsn-news-list-item__p">MSCI research reveals trends that highlight significant traction. In 2020, fewer women became directors, but all-male boards continued to decline worldwide to 17% in 2020 (a 2 p.p. drop) among the ACWI contingent. This trend is partially driven by emerging markets, where all-male boards dropped to 31%, from over 34% initially. Hong Kong is one of the few places that actually experienced an increase of 5 p.p. in all-male boards. In contrast, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s share reduced by 8 p.p. to 86% in 2020.</p>

And while the many of the women who sit on Boards are non-execs, the majority of the women making it to the Executive Team are in staff rather than line roles, what BoardEx refers to as roles of &lsquo;influence&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;power.&rsquo;</p>
