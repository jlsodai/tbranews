        <p>As we mark World Refugee Day, we are proud to unveil the third cohort of the Amahoro Fellowship, a bold and growing movement of exceptional leaders with lived experience as forcibly displaced persons (FDPs). Handpicked from a competitive pool of over <b>1600 applications</b> across the Continent, this year’s cohort represents the diversity, resilience, and brilliance of a new generation determined to shape the future of Africa and the world.</p>
        <p>This year’s cohort includes Fellows from <b>10 African countries</b>, including first-time representation from Malawi, Cameroon, Libya and Zambia. Over <b>53% of the selected Fellows are women</b>, and for the first time the cohort features filmmakers, pastry chefs, environmental advocates, among many other diverse professionals. This diversity reflects Amahoro Coalition’s belief that transformative change comes from every sector, every voice, and every lived experience.</p>
        <p>The Amahoro Fellowship is a 12-month leadership program designed to empower forcibly displaced leaders to drive bold, systems-level change. Through this journey, Fellows will gain access to a wide global network, high-impact learning experiences, speaking opportunities on international platforms, and collaborative projects that amplify their voices and solutions. It’s not just a Fellowship, it’s a launchpad for collective leadership, deep solidarity, and lasting impact.</p>
        <p>As we welcome Cohort 3, we look forward to a year of connection, creation, and courageous action. Together, these Fellows are not just imagining a better future for displaced communities, they are building it.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned as we introduce each Fellow in the coming days and follow their journey through the year.</p>

        <h3>Shifting the lens: Amahoro Coalition at the Festival de Cannes</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg8yueznc/image/upload/v1750401367/amahoroIcons_wjxuke.jpg" alt="">
        <p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 10px 0 15px;"><i>From left to right: Rajendra Roy (MoMA, panelist), Maryna Er Gorbach (filmmaker), Vanja Kaludjercic (IFFR), Shirin Pakfar (UNHCR), Alison Tilbe (DFF), Mo Harawe (filmmaker), Tamara Tatishvili (IFFR/HBF), Gilbert Mucyo (Amahoro Coalition), Cate Blanchet (actor, producer, UNHCR Global Goodwill Ambassador), Wim Pijbes (Droom en Daad), Clare Stewart (IFFR), Ayman Tamer (The Tamer Family Foundation), Koji Yanai (UNIQLO, Master Mind).

        <p>This year at the Festival de Cannes, Amahoro Coalition proudly stood alongside global icons and storytellers as one of the founding partners of the Displacement Film Fund, a bold new initiative to support filmmakers with lived experience of displacement or a powerful record of telling stories from the margins.</p>
        <p>Launched at International Film Festival Rotterdam 2025 by UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Cate Blanchett, the Displacement Film Fund is supported by Master Mind, Uniqlo, Droom en Daad, the Tamer Family Foundation and Amahoro Coalition as Founding Partners. The Fund is managed by the Hubert Bals Fund, with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, serving as the Strategic Partner. In its pilot year, the Fund will award five production grants of €100,000 each.</p>
        <p>One of the inaugural laureates of the Displacement Film Fund is <b>Mo Harawe, an Amahoro Fellow and Film director, screenwriter, and producer from Somalia.</b> His debut feature film The Village Next to Paradise premiered in the prestigious Un Certain Regard Section at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and was subsequently invited to several major festivals, including Sarajevo IFF, Melbourne, Toronto IFF. Before his debut, he gained recognition for his short films. Life on The Horn (2022) received a Special Mention at Locarno International Film Festival, while Will My Parents Come to See Me (2022) was nominated for the European Film Award, won the Grand Prix at Clermont-Ferrand as well as German LOLA and Austrian Film Award for Best Short Film in 2023.</p>
        <p>At Amahoro Coalition, we believe cinema can do more than entertain. It can challenge stereotypes, create empathy, and give voice to the lived realities of millions across the African continent and beyond. Our presence at Cannes is part of a broader commitment to elevate underrepresented African voices in global conversations, whether in policy rooms, boardrooms, or on the big screen.</p>

        <h3>One year of impact: Mentoring leaders with lived experience of displacement</h3>
        <br>

        <p>One year ago, Amahoro Coalition and PSA BDP came together to launch a groundbreaking mentorship program for young leaders with lived experience of displacement. Built on the foundation of the Amahoro Fellowship, this initiative set out to connect these leaders with influential mentors across industries and continents, opening doors, sparking growth, and building lasting networks of support.</p>
        <p>Twelve months on, the results speak for themselves. The partnership has not only grown stronger, but it has also created meaningful, measurable impact in the lives and leadership journeys of the mentees. From newfound confidence to career shifts and deeper purpose, their reflections tell a powerful story.</p>

        <p>Amahoro Coalition was proud to serve as a strategic partner for the 2025 EBCR Career Fair, organized by the European Business Chamber of Rwanda in collaboration with the EU Delegation. The event brought together over 50 European and Rwandan companies with young professionals, creating a timely opportunity to explore new employment pipelines for refugees and displaced communities living in Rwanda.</p>
        <p>In line with our mission to unlock economic inclusion across vulnerable settings, we have been working with EBCR to ensure that talent from displaced backgrounds was visible, supported and connected to meaningful private sector opportunities. The event also marked the launch of the EBCR Youth Professional Network, another step toward long-term career development for all youth, including those too often excluded.</p>
