        <h3>Trust is catalytic: a key takeaway from the recently concluded AFD2025</h3>

        <p>This Forum was not just a gathering of experts: it was a platform for dreamers, doers, entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors. Young people with lived experience led the way. The Forum culminated in a moment of immense pride: watching the first cohort of #AmahoroFellows graduate, representing a new generation of doers.</p>
        <p>One realization became crystal clear: we have moved past debating WHETHER to invest in communities with high refugee populations. That case has been made. The only question remaining is: WHAT is stopping us from going #allin?</p>
        <p>Trust emerged as the Forum’s linking thread. When leaders take bold, decisive action, they create ripples of possibility that inspire others to follow. New stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and regions stepped forward with tangible commitments. As I witnessed this unfold, I understood; while momentum is contagious, trust is catalytic.</p>

        <p class="mt-10">The Amahoro Fellowship is more than a professional development program, it is a bold movement redefining leadership in the context of forced displacement. Launched by the Amahoro Coalition, the Fellowship equips African leaders with lived experience of displacement with the resources, coaching, and recognition that traditional systems often overlook. After a year of intensive capacity building, funding, and connection, Cohort One has officially graduated, having sharpened their purpose, scaled their ventures, and united as a pan-African community of changemakers. Fondly known as the “All-Inners,” they’ve shown that displaced leaders are not victims but that they are visionaries instead.</p>

        <h3>Passport and Labour Mobility Experience at AFD2025</h3>

        <p>At the Forum, the Passport Experience offered a powerful, immersive reminder of what mobility truly means and why it matters. Designed to mirror the layered barriers faced by displaced individuals and low-mobility citizens across Africa, the experience challenged participants to reimagine borders not as walls, but as gateways to dignity and opportunity.</p>
        <p>This moment was more than symbolic; it was deeply aligned with Amahoro Coalition’s mission to unlock the potential of all people through labour mobility and inclusive systems. As Africa approaches its demographic tipping point, achieving the continent’s promise depends on whether everyone, including the forcibly displaced, can move, work, and contribute freely. The Passport Experience made it clear: mobility is not a privilege; it is the key to realizing Africa’s shared prosperity.</p>

        <p>Amahoro Coalition hosted leaders from across agribusiness, government, and philanthropy to explore how Africa’s arid and displacement-affected regions can unlock their full agrifood potential. With over 45 million forcibly displaced people on the continent, this invite-only roundtable called for bold, market-driven solutions that are inclusive, climate-smart, and led by local communities. From regenerative aquaculture to youth-led food innovation, the future of Africa’s food systems is being reshaped not in spite of displacement, but by embracing it as a catalyst for transformation. This meeting took place in Nairobi, Kenya on the sidelines of the Africa Forum on Displacement 2025. </p>

        <p>On the sidelines of AFD2025, the Board of the Amahoro Coalition convened in Nairobi for a strategic meeting to review progress and align on key priorities. Discussions focused on deepening private sector engagement, scaling support for refugee-led enterprises, and advancing labour mobility solutions that unlock opportunities for displaced communities across Africa. The Board also received updates on the ongoing recruitment of Cohort 3 of the Amahoro Fellows, a flagship initiative dedicated to leaders with lived experience of displacement. In addition, members reviewed ongoing governance and financial strengthening efforts to ensure the Coalition remains well-positioned to deliver on its mission: mobilizing African leadership and investment to create inclusive, sustainable pathways for displaced people to thrive.</p>

        <p>With nearly 50 million people forcibly displaced across Africa, we’re overlooking a fast-growing labor force, a resilient base of entrepreneurs, and a large consumer market. Forward-thinking companies are already tapping into this potential and seeing results. #AFD2025 is where these ideas turn into action. Designed for and by the private sector, the Africa Forum on Displacement is a launchpad for business-driven solutions that create jobs, drive profits, and deliver real impact for displaced communities.</p>

        <p>As climate change continues to drive displacement across Africa, the urgency to scale bold, climate-resilient solutions has never been greater. This year, the <b>Africa Forum on Displacement</b> will spotlight exactly that — how we invest in and grow innovations that protect both people and the planet. Among those helping to shape this vital conversation is <b>Zang Luka, a graduating Amahoro Fellow from our inaugural cohort</b>. A Nigerian entrepreneur and founder of Zang Global, Zang transforms electronic and agricultural waste into sustainable products like solar lanterns, power banks, and biodegradable packaging. His work, rooted in his own experience as an internally displaced person (IDP), is a powerful example of the kind of ingenuity Africa needs:  where lived experience meets environmental responsibility to create lasting impact.</p>
        <p>Join Zang Luka and other inspiring Amahoro Fellows at #AFD2025 in Nairobi on 30 April to discover how they’re driving real change in displaced communities across Africa  and how you can partner with them to scale impact.
