		<p>Hello [[FIRSTNAME]],</p>
		<p>I hope you're having a great week so far.</p>
		<p>My name is Osayomon Gaius-Obaseki. I'm the Senior Strategic Programmes Manager at TheBoardroom Africa. I lead our programmes team to design all our executive development offerings. We partner with some of the globe's most trusted experts and institutions to bring affordable but world-class programmes and certificates to our members - Our partnership with the <a href="https://www.iod.com/">UK Institute of Directors</a> is a case in point. We pride ourselves in ensuring that our programmes are well curated with a local but global outlook with global faculty, and to date, we are proud to say that 350+ members have graduated from our executive programmes.</p>
		<p>I would like to schedule a call with you to tell you more about some of these programmes, share any special member offers or subsidies, and to generally get a sense of how I can best support you. If you are interested in a 30-minute chat with me, please follow this link to set up a time that is convenient for you. <a href="https://calendly.com/ogaiusobaseki/tbrafricaprogrammes?month=2023-05">Schedule with my Calendly</a>.</p>
		<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
