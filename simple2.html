	<p>Do you believe your life would be better if you were perfect - smarter, richer, thinner, or more accomplished? Most of us are conditioned to think that if we can just figure out how to get it <strong>'right'</strong>, we would feel better. But perfectionism isn't really about self-improvement; it's about approval. Perfectionism is the belief that if we live, look and act perfectly, we can minimise or avoid the pain of judgement and shame. Instead, it often ends up having the opposite effect.</p>
