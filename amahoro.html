        <h3>Leaders in Conversation: The “Why” Behind the Partnership</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Before the landmark signing ceremony, Ayo Sotinrin (Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture of Nigeria) and Isaac Kwaku Fokuo (Curator at Amahoro Coalition) sat down to reflect on the deeper reasons driving this partnership. They explored the “WHY”: why it matters, why it makes business sense and why the time to act is now.</p>
        <p>Ayo, newly appointed to lead the Bank of Agriculture in April, shared that his top priority is addressing food security in Nigeria with a vision to later scale impact across Africa. He spoke about how his visit to Kakuma during the last Africa Forum on Displacement deeply inspired him, from conversations with refugees and partners to witnessing firsthand the resilience and innovation in the community.</p>

        <h3>Reflections from the Field: Understanding Nigeria’s Displacement Landscape</h3>

        <p>Our colleague Julius Muriuki has been working with internally displaced people across Nigeria. In this piece he shares some of his reflections on what makes Nigeria’s displacement context unique compared to East Africa, where refugees are often concentrated in camps. He highlights the scale, dispersion, and complexity of Nigeria’s situation, where more than 3 million people are displaced across vast distances, while also pointing to promising opportunities in job readiness training, digital skills, and agriculture that can restore dignity and create livelihoods for displaced communities.</p>
        <p>Drawing from his experience, Julius reflects on the logistical and financial challenges of reaching displaced populations spread across multiple states, but also on the resilience and creativity of these communities. He underscores how partnerships with organizations like Jobberman and initiatives such as the Amahoro Skills Hub are paving new pathways to employment. Most importantly, he reminds us that with the right investment and coordination, Nigeria’s displaced populations can become active contributors to food systems, local economies, and national stability.</p>

        <h3>Pathways to Employment in Nigeria</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="imgfloat" style="width: 230px;" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg8yueznc/image/upload/v1759134364/amahoroSept5_rfzrid.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Our Pathways to Employment Report reveals that refugees in Nigeria, despite their skills and resilience. face major barriers to work.</p>
        <p>Policy ambiguity, restrictive requirements like the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, and limited private sector engagement have left many refugees excluded from formal employment. Most rely on informal work, small unregistered businesses, or incentive-based volunteering, while opportunities in digital livelihoods remain underdeveloped.</p>
        <p>At Amahoro Coalition, we believe this must change. Refugees are not a burden but a resource for Nigeria’s economy. We are calling for clear employment guidelines, targeted exemptions, stronger entrepreneurship support, and deeper private sector partnerships to unlock this potential.</p>
        <p>Join us in advocating for more and better jobs for refugees across Nigeria and Africa and explore the full Pathways to Employment report series here:</p>

        <p>They called him “Mai boola“, the trash carrier. It was a condescending nickname, a dismissal of a man who had left a respectable teaching job to wade into the messy, informal world of waste collection. To his family, it didn’t make sense that a university graduate with a degree in pure and applied chemistry would choose a path that looked, to them, like a step backward.</p>
        <p>But for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/agwukaluibe/">Agwu Kalu Ibe</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/levelup-recyclers-limited/">LevelUp Recyclers Limited</a>, this path was a direct line to solving some of Nigeria’s most deeply entrenched problems. His company, launched in December 2020, isn’t just about waste management. It’s a social enterprise built on a simple but powerful idea: turning waste into wealth, not for one person, but for the most vulnerable people in the value chain.</p>
        <p>Based in Abuja, Level Up Recyclers specifically partners with people living in the city’s 16 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, creating predictable income for communities shattered by conflict.</p>

        <p>Amahoro Coalition brought together private sector leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and refugees in New York this week, on the sidelines of the UN’s 80th General Assembly, to explore how migration and forced displacement will shape the markets of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>At a time when migrants are too often excluded or seen as a burden, our dialogue highlighted a different truth: displaced people are contributors, bringing economic, social and cultural value to their host communities.</p>
        <p>Key insights stood out: displaced populations are untapped markets of talent and innovation; the private sector must lead in turning potential into opportunity; and Africa’s demographic dividend cannot be unlocked if millions of marginalized people are left behind.</p>
        <p>Migration is one of the defining challenges of our time and one where cooperation, investment, and fresh thinking can turn vulnerability into shared prosperity.</p>

        <p>Our colleagues Isaac Kwaku Fokuo, Curator and Founder, and Tito Mbathi, Senior Strategy Innovator at Amahoro Coalition, contributed an opinion piece to the New African special #UNGA80 edition, shedding light on how Africa’s displaced people are far more than a humanitarian challenge, they are a powerful economic force.</p>
        <p>Opening with the story of Fatima, a livestock trader in Mogadishu who runs an export network to the Gulf entirely from her phone, the article argues that Africa’s more than 50 million displaced persons represent one of the world’s most overlooked markets: innovative, resilient, and generating billions in annual economic activity. At a time when traditional aid is shrinking, this moment presents a unique opportunity for market-based solutions that combine development impact with sustainable returns.</p>
        <p>Read the full article here to explore how reframing displacement as an economic opportunity can transform markets across Africa.</p>
